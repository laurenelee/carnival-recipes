Jamie's Mac-n-Cheese Pizza

Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 cup panko breadcrumbs
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 cup grated mozzarella
1/2 cup Parmesan
1/2 pound dried rotini pasta
Olive oil cooking spray
6 slices thick-cut good quality bacon
Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions:

2. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the rotini al dente.
3. Drain and spray with olive oil cooking spray, making sure the noodles are coated well. Set aside.
5. Remove all but 1 tablespoon of the bacon drippings and add the butter. Add the onions, garlic and nutmeg.
8. Continue to cook until you have a blond roux, about 5 minutes.
9. Whisk in the milk until you have a thick enough sauce that it coats the back of a spoon.
13. Take the rest of the crumbled bacon and add it to the bowl, stirring well to combine.
14. Spray the pizza dough with the olive oil spray and place into the oven for 7 minutes.
15. Remove from the oven and set down. Spread the macaroni and cheese on the pizza, being careful to leave a 1-inch border.
17. Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes to set the macaroni and cheese.
